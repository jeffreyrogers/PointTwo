# PointTwo: Get distance between two points

This is my first Swift app and I wrote it in about 3 hours, so there are
probably better ways to do things. In particular, I found aligning text elements
tricky.

The purpose of this app is to measure distances between two geographical points.
While it was primarily a learning project for me, it had some practical benefit
since I wanted to know how far my apartment is from the park I sometimes run
at (I am aware there are other, easier ways of finding this out).

Never having written a Swift app before, or even an iOS app, I wasn't sure what
to expect going into it. But it was a fairly pleasant experience. Apple's
documentation isn't very helpful unless you already know what you're looking
for, but there are a lot of tutorials online and using these I was able to piece
together enough of what I needed to get something working.

Future apps should be a bit easier now that I have a better grasp of how Swift
apps work. SwiftUI is fun and intuitive.
